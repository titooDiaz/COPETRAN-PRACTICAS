# COPETRAN-PRACTICAS
Hello! This is a project for my school practices. The project is built with Django (Python), and I will be uploading constant updates. 

If you want to start the project, you can do the following:

Create your virtual environment:
- `pip install virtualenv`
- `virtualenv env`

Now, you can enter the following in your console:
- `git clone https://github.com/titooUvU/COPETRAN-PRACTICAS.git`

Next, navigate to the project's root folder in the console using the "cd" command until you reach where the `manage.py` file is located.

Now, you need to apply the migrations:
- `python manage.py makemigrations`

Then, apply the migrations to the database:
- `python manage.py migrate`

Great, now you can start the server:
- `python manage.py runserver`

Remember to have all the necessary elements installed:
- Python
- Git
- Pip

Also, make sure to install the requirements:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (remember to do this from the console where the file is located).
